## Description
This application was designed so users can dynamically generate employee cards using node.js in tandem with the inquirer npm. The app will ask a series of questions regarding the employee's name, id, and email as well their specific postion within the company. Once the input for the position question has been answered, then another set of questions will be asked in response to what specific position was selected. Once all criteria is met, then a html page will be created with all the employees and their cards dynamically attached.

## Usuage
To use this program, node.js must be installed as well as the inquirer npm on version 8.2.4. Using this code, open up the integrated terminal on index.js and run "node index.js" . Once all the questions have been answered you will see inside the generated folder that there is a new output.html file that holds the html for the new webpage and all the cards within that page will hold all the information provided by questions and their answers.
